Family To-Do List
===============

### Summary
The **Family To-Do List's** main focus was on **real-time** family organization. The app's purpose is to allow families to share tasks among members. We wanted a single point of contact where families can communicate and organize events from small get togethers to large events like birthdays and reunions. Start by making an account and the app can make your family life a little easier!
